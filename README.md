# About C-Bank Pro
C-Bank Pro is a simple console-based banking application implemented in C. It allows users to create accounts, perform various banking operations, and check their account balance.

# Prerequisites
Before you can run the C-Bank Pro application, you need to ensure that you have the following software/tools installed on your system:
1. **A C Compiler (e.g., GCC):** You need a C compiler to compile and run the code. You can download GCC for your platform from the official website: [GCC Downloads](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/index.html "GCC Downloads")
2. **A Windows-based system:** This application relies on certain Windows-specific libraries (e.g., conio.h, windows.h), so its recommended to run it on a Windows system.

# Getting Started
